        description: ` 
        As the Fullstack developer, I helped develop a web app to address the need for synthetic medical datasets of diverse skin tones in cancer diagnosis, utilizing flask and Google Colab to deploy custom AI model pipelines for skin lesion classification, segmentation, and style transfer. 
        I also streamlined an Express RESTful API architecture to facilitate data transmission. 
        I implemented server-sided image encoding, file bundling and compression, enabling efficient exports of generated datasets in .ZIP format. 
        Furthermore, I integrated server responses into a React and Bootstrap UI. 
        I also succesfully deployed the web service on Google Cloud App Engine. 
        Overall, it was a great learning experience for web development.
